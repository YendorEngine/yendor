# Yendor Has Load Progress

Helper plugin and derive macro for tracking the load progress of nested structs containing asset handles.

This crate exposes a trait [HasLoadProgress] that may be derived on structs that contain Bevy asset [Handle]s. The idea is that you may have a struct with asset handles contained somewhere inside, maybe deeply nested or stored in vectors, etc., and you need to be able to get the load progress of all of the handles inside that struct.
